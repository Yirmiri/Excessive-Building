Version Release v3.3.0 Fabric/Quilt-1.21(1.)/1.20.1

  Hammer
•   The hammer is a new tool created using amethyst and can mine many blocks that normally don't have a tool assigned to them such as glass
•   The hammer can also be used to "hammer" various blocks into new states such as engraving sandstone or turning mosaic into boards
•   The hammer is also how almentra statues are obtained which is via hammering a polished almentra block
•   The hammer also increases knockback based on player movement speed and has higher damage than other items (can be configured)
•   Hammers can be enabled/disabled via the config (on by default)

•   Added an advancement to go along with hammering a block

  Misc Additions
•   Added uk_ua translations (@unroman)

...this will replace the textures fully on 1.22+ versions of the mod
•   Added pack icons to built-in resource packs
•   Ancient fruit now creates mundane potions when using water instead of awkward potions
•   Moved custom tooltips to a separate client configuration

  Changes

•   Updated the texture of almentra statues
•   Updated the texture of ancient leaves
•   Updated the texture of asphalt (THANK YOU @bricker_man)
•   Updated the colors of lime, pink, and brown almentra
•   Updated the models for orange, cyan, purple, magenta, pink, and brown almentra statues (THANK YOU FOR HELP @tellioaridoitsu AND @hecco)
•   Removed recipes for many blocks such as almentra statues or thick paper walls as these are obtained via the hammer now
•   Removed chests from the Excessive Building creative tab
•   Updated contributor capes

  Fixes
•   Fixed an issue that caused the model of waxed copper brick vertical stairs to not rotate
•   Fixed an issue that caused mossy cobblestone brick slabs to drop normal cobblestone brick slabs
•   Fixed an issue that caused the comment for "Content Toggles" in the config file to be written at the bottom

•   Special Thanks to:
@CreationsKeke - for helping out with moving the mod over to MultiLoader (may or may not be out at the time of you reading this)
@tellioaridoitsu - for helping out with a bunch of the new almentra statues!
@Hecco - for helping with the new orange almentra statue!
@bricker_man - for helping with the new asphalt texture!

  Note
•   I know I've said it a few times in the past but I really need to focus on new things, so for now this will be the last major "content" update for a while.
I will maintain the mod for the latest major modding version, I am happy with the state the mod is and I think it is time to finally let it rest.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version Release v3.2.3 Fabric/Quilt-1.21(1.)/1.20.1

  Misc Additions
•   Added amethyst lamps
•   Added thin and thick paper blocks
•   Added the "Terrain" painting
•   Added an "Oak" prefix to Chest and Trapped Chest blocks (via built in pack so it can be toggled)

  Changes
•   Updated hardness and sound for almentra

•   Updated the texture and model of reaching lanterns
•   Updated the recipe for reaching lanterns
•   Updated wording of some configuration options to help convey what they do better
•   Updated description of the mod

  Fixes
•   Fixed an issue that caused custom sherds and gloom seeds to not appear from loot tables

  1.20.1 Notices
•   For 1.20.1 this update changes/updates Excessive Building to it's current state on 1.21 meaning it is very incompatible with previous versions,
proceed with caution and be sure to backup worlds.
•   Due to the block reach attribute not existing on this version (and me not wanting to recreate it just for one version) any case in which
block reach was given will be replaced with haste, if you do not like this it is configurable.

  Extra Notes :P
•   I did want to improve/redo the concept of gloom trees this update but didn't have time as I wanted to release an updated version of 1.20.1's port before
I drop it entirely since the current state of the mod on that version is rather embarrassing. I plan to fuse the idea of gloom trees with how fiery crystals
worked back on the old version of the mod, so stay tuned for new light blocks! Expect custom tree generation and a new way to obtain them aswell.

Version Release V2.0.0 (Forge/NeoForge: 1.20.1) (Fabric/Quilt: 1.20.1)
The 100K Update! - Major Update

•   Thank you all so much for helping reach 100K downloads, I really didn't think my silly block mode would go so far and was infact made on April Fools because I didn't
think it would get so far enough for me to do this. I ended up finding that there is an entire art/modding Minecraft community out there and became part of it! I am truly
thankful to be where I am, and as a thank you to you all I have compiled a bunch of ideas I have seen people wanted in this mod and put it all in this update + more, enjoy :)<3

  CHANGES EXCLUSIVE TO FABRIC V2.0.0
Originally this update was given to Forge players before Fabric as I really wanted to clean some of the yuck left over in the Fabric mod's codebase...
•   Vertical stairs can now be waterlogged
•   All wooden blocks will now properly burn and spread fire
•   Alchemist & potion shelves now increase the enchanting table's enchantability
•   Added all previously missed updates
•   Soul magma blocks now do double damage again (will come to Forge next update)
•   Updated world generation to match the Forge port's version
•   Updated a lot of the codebase to be cleaner- probably won't have much impact on gameplay
•   As a temporary alternative to the reaching effect you can obtain haste via eating ancient fruit, this will be changed when the officially support interaction reach

  Additions
•   Added the ancient woodset (sapling can be obtained from sniffers sniffing up the ground)
•   Added ancient fruit which drops uncommonly from ancient leaves, ancient fruit can be brewed into a potion of reaching which increases interaction reach for the duration of its effect
NOTE: Reaching is currently only on Forge since they support block reach as an attribute, and while yes I could add it to Fabric I'd rather wait since it will be officially supported by Minecraft innnn 1.21... or 1.20.5? idk anymore-
•   Added new ladder variants (a new ladder recipe has been added to make room for variant ladders, this includes the original ladder however the old recipe remains for those that don't wanna use specific planks)
•   Added polished stone and polished stone bricks
•   Added polished calcite blocks & cracked calcite tiles
•   Added brickshelves & nether brickshelves (these are meant to be a silly item, was inspired after seeing a post made by @qzimyion)
•   Added basketweave and herringbone brick variants (aswell as the missing cracked bricks variant)
•   Added stone, deepslate, & blackstone lamps (aswell as blackstone windows)
•   All asphalt blocks no longer give speed however you can now choose to tint them to have speed applied
•   Added swift asphalt (a variant of asphalt that increases speed) and asphalt block variants (stairs, slabs, and vertical stairs)
•   Added polished basalt blocks, can be crafted from smooth basalt

  Changes
•   Changed a bunch of textures to match my newer style of art aswell as a lot of vanilla color/texture parity
•   The biggest victim of the above texture changes are the polished andesite, diorite, and granite bricks.
These blocks now resemble their base polished variants MUCH better than before which allows them to better fit into builds utilizing those blocks.
•   Adjusted Excessive Building creative tab slightly
•   Obsidian bricks and tiles are now immune to the Ender Dragon
•   Smithing tables can now be broken using both an axe or pickaxe
•   Added a recipe for fiery and kyanite shards due to there being no way to renew them yet
•   Changed calcite bricks recipe to utilize the new polished calcite instead
•   Changed the recipes for brimstone windows and lamps
•   Amethyst lamp recipe has been buffed to grant 2 instead of 1
•   Fiery lamp recipe has been slightly changed to cost 1 less nether brick and 1 more fiery crystal
•   All lamp blocks including sea lamps now drop themselves at all times (glowstone still drops glowstone dust)
•   Updated stone mason trades (this only applies to Excessive Building's custom trades)
•   Added all crystal and shards to the cleric's trades to make obtaining them in bulk easier

  KNOWN ISSUES
•   Mud tile, snow brick, and netherite brick walls do not have a model- these I have 0 clue how they got into the mod but I may aswell add them as full features when I get the chance
•   Villagers may not have custom trades other than asphalt
•   Soul magma does not produce a bubble column
These will be addressed and fixed next update, for now I want to take a little break and work on my new mod excessive_building

  Bug Fixes
•   Fixed polished blackstone tiles and its variants from being crafted (Forge/Fabric)
•   Added Excessive Building's Nether wood block variants to the "non_flammable_woods" tag which should solve some issues in which other mods use that tag (Forge/Fabric)
•   Fixed various recipes that previously were broken (Forge/Fabric)
•   Not a bug but thought it would be stupid to mention I removed the extra c in the changelog file's border at the top (ALL :P)

  Technical Changes
•   Asphalt blocks are no longer considered "speed blocks"
•   Features no longer have the _placed suffix (this also effects /place)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version Release 1.2.2 (1.19.2 Fabric)
Port Update

  Changes
•   Created Fabric port of the mod currently for version 1.19.2 (1.19.4 and 1.20.1 will release after Fabric betas are finished just so I don't have to juggle 3 versions.. and maybe 1.18.2 if I have time)
•   Currently some features have not been ported yet because I'm tired asf rn (in all seriousness though they will be added in the future)
these features are: Vertical stairs, light blocks, construction workers, any function table (including construction table), natural generation of fiery crystal and brimstone (still can be crafted), and asphalt blocks, DO expect these
to release eventually.. whenever I can get to it <3

Hotfix Update

  Bug Fixes
